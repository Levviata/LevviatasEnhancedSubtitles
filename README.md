# Levviata's Enhanced Subtitles

A 1.12.2 Minecraft client mod made, with and for, the Forge Modloader which aims at improving the user experience of Minecraft's subtitles.

# Requirements

- **Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11 / Linux Ubuntu, Debian, etc. / Any other compatible operational system with the Forge Modloader.**
    - _Mod as only been tested on Windows 10 and will only receive support for window's versions._
    - _Guide only covers Window usage, if you are on Linux I will take it as you already know how to do the things below, if not, Youtube is your friend_.

- **Basic computer knowledge:**
  * Basic knowledge about **_folder directories_**.
  * Know how to and what _**Left Click**_ and _**Right Click**_ do as well as how to open files.
  * Know how to use _**File Explorer**_ for basic file traversing.
  * **_Etcetera..._**
  * _If you do not know how to do any of the things above, or perhaps something else in this relate, you can always use Youtube or ask help from other folks_. 

- **Official Minecraft launcher + Premium Minecraft Java**
    - _Yes, other Minecraft launchers (ATlauncher, Prism Launcher, etc.) that support Forge can run this mod, only thing is, I will not be covering them in this guide._
    - _Also Yes, this mod does work in Offline Minecraft (or more so, 'Cracked' Minecraft) but I will not be aiding you, search for the appropiate guides online_.
- **Java 8 for 1.12.2 to 1.17.x ~~/ Java 17 for version 1.18.x and up~~**
    - _Java 8 is the only needed as the 1.18 port of this mod has not yet been uploaded_
    - _I do note manually downloading Java 8 ~~or 17~~ is not necessary if you have already played the versions 1.12.x - 1.17.x of Minecraft as Java should have been installed for those versions by the installer_[^1]
    - You can manually get Java 8 [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
# How to use

1. Download the Forge Modloader ('Latest version' and 'Recommended version' all work so download either) from their [official page](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html), afterwards, double **Left Click** or **Right Click** > **'Open'** the file to open up the installer interface, now, the installer window should have popped up, by default the option **'Install Client'** should be choosen, if so, click the button **'OK'** in the bottom left of the installation window, then, wait a little (or a long time, depends on your wifi download speed) until you see a window pop up that says something along the lines:
~~~text
Succesfully installed client profile forge for version 1.12.2-forge-14.23.5.2860 into launcher
~~~
Then press **'OK'** in the window that just popped up and the installer should close off, now go to your official launcher and you will see how Forge is selected as the version to play with, you are now good to go to the next step.

2. Download my mod's latest release either on [its own Github release page](https://github.com/yeahfrick/LevviatasEnhancedSubtitles/releases/), ~~CurseForge~~ or ~~Modrinth~~ (yet to be released on both websites), when you have done so, you should have downloaded a .jar named **'LevviatasEnhancedSubtitles vX.X.X'** (X refers to the current version number or, in the current time I am writing this, '**v1.0.0**', so all together should form **'LevviatasEnhancedSubtitles v1.0.0'**), to see where to put the file you have just downloaded as to play the mod continue reading below.

## Where to put the .jar file

As usual, you should put the file on (or in the folder you downloaded Minecraft):
~~~text
C:\Users\YourUserHere\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods
~~~ 
- _'**YourUserHere**' referring to the name of the user you have just signed in your pc._
- _**'C:\ '** is your disk's letter._
- _You can access this directory by pressing **WIN + R** (the big key with the window's logo), then inputting **'%appdata%'** and pressing **ENTER**. '**.minecraft'** is a hidden file so you will not be able to see it naturally, follow [this guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5#WindowsVersion=Windows_11) as to be able to see them (Windows 7 and 8 are pretty much the same as far as I'm aware)._

If the folder does not exist in that directory, create a folder _EXACTLY_ named '**mods**' in the directory '**.minecraft**' or in other words in:
~~~text
C:\Users\YourUserHere\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft
~~~ 
And then put the .jar file you have downloaded in the folder you have just created, in this case, in the '**mods**' folder and you will be more than done, now you can go to your launcher and launch your game using the Forge version you have installed which you can find in the version selecter on the bottom left of your client.


[^1]: [Java 8 is required to run Minecraft versions 1.12 through 1.17. Java 17 is required to run Minecraft version 1.18 and up. If you don't know whether you have the necessary version of Java, don't worry, our installers supply Minecraft with its own version of Java by default.](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409225939853#h_01FFJMSQWJH31CH16H63GX4YKE)
