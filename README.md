# Levviata's Enhanced Subtitles

A 1.12.2 Minecraft mod made, with and for, the Forge Modloader which aims at improving the user experience of Minecraft's subtitles.

# Requirements

- **Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11 / Linux Ubuntu, Debian, etc. / Any other compatible operational system with the Forge Modloader.**
    - _(Guide only covers Window usage, if you are on Linux I will take it as you already know how to do the things below, if not, Youtube is your friend)_.

- **Basic computer knowledge:** 
  * Basic knowledge about **_folder directories_**.
  * Know how to and what _**Left Click**_ and _**Right Click**_ do as well as how to open files.
  * Know how to use _**File Explorer**_ for basic file traversing.
  * **_Etcetera..._**
  * _If you do not know how to do any of the things above, or perhaps something else in this relate, you can always use Youtube or ask help from other folks_. 

- **Official Minecraft launcher + copy of premium minecraft**
    - _Yes, other Minecraft launchers that support Forge can run this mod, only thing is, I will not be covering them in this guide._
    - _Also Yes, this mod does work in Offline Minecraft (or more so, 'Cracked' Minecraft) but I will not be aiding you, search for the appropiate guides online_.
- **Java 8 for 1.12.2 to 1.17.x / Java 17 for version 1.18.x and up**
    - _This is not necessary if you have already played the versions 1.12.x - 1.17.x of Minecraft as Java should have been already installed for those versions[^1]

# How to use

First, download the Forge Modloader from their [official page](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html), afterwards, double left click or right click > 'Open' the file to open up the installer interface, now, the installer window should have popped up, by default (latest version and recommended version all work so download either) download the Mod's latest release either on [its own Github release page](https://github.com/yeahfrick/LevviatasEnhancedSubtitles/releases/), ~~CurseForge~~ or ~~Modrinth~~ (yet to be released on both websites).

If you have downloaded a .jar named **'LevviatasEnhancedSubtitles vX.X.X'** (X refers to the current version name or, in the current time I am writing this, '**v1.0.0**', so all together should form **'LevviatasEnhancedSubtitles v1.0.0'**) from any of the websites listed above continue reading below.

## Where to put the .jar file

As usual, you should put the file on:
~~~text
C:\Users\YourUserHere\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods
~~~ 
'**YourUserHere**' refering to your PC's name, **'C:\ '** might not be your disk's letter or perhaps the folder does not exist in that directory, if so, create a folder _EXACTLY named_ '**mods**' in the directory '**.minecraft**' or in other words in:
~~~text
C:\Users\YourUserHere\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft
~~~ 
And then put the .jar file you have downloaded in the folder you have just created, in this case, in the '**mods**' folder.
